# Simple-EDA-of-IMDB-database
Hello there, this is a simple movie data analysis of the IMDB database using Kaggle.

With this project, I aim to answer a few questions about how the cinema industry has evolved over the last One hundred years. 

My main questions are:
Has the average movie runtime changed over the last century of the movie industry?
How many movies do we have on this database?
Which country has the lead in movie making?
What is the most common genre?
